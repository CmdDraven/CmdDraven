Hi! I'm James, known online as Cmd Draven for many years now- depending on the circle anyway. Some of my past experiences include scripting on 'Furcadia' in my teens (if anybody remembers DS!), some light Dev work for GMod Servers and co-building the 'Hyper Experimental Tier' mod for Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance Forever.

I'm not a coder. I’m not fluent in bitwise logic, compiler design or any of the deeply technical guts of what I’m building. Everything here is AI-assisted — I feed the ideas, the structure and the philosophy. I sketch the skeletons and define the bones, and the machine helps flesh them out. I see myself more as an architect than engineer. Until a team shows up (if they ever do), I’ll be piloting this solo, with a co-pilot made of silicon. (I swear to god HAL, you better behave this time)

Nothing here is trying to compete with the tech giants, or disrupt anything for the sake of disruption. I just want to see what I can make work; if anything sticks, so to speak. And if any of it sparks progress beyond my own desk, great. If not — I’ll still be glad I made the attempt.

This space will likely be R&D (likely kept private for a while until things make some kind of sense) and various tools and Linux packages of tbc usefulness. I've started a 'company' called Synavera, or synavera_discorporated. Based on "Synapse" and "Veracity", software under this umbrella will be beholden to a strict ethos dictating User Agency, Privacy, Security and Granular Control.
