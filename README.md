Hello! I’m James I.T. Wylie, known online as CmdDraven.
Most of my early tinkering happened in small communities and games: DragonSpeak scripting on Furcadia in my teens, modding for GMod servers, and co-building the Hyper Experimental Tier mod for Supreme Commander: FAF.

I only moved into proper software architecture recently, and I still see myself as early in the journey. I’m learning continuously, trying to earn my place by building with intention and refining my understanding piece by piece.

My work now gathers under Synavera Discorporated, a personal R&D umbrella focused on tools that respect the user—emphasising agency, privacy, transparency, and security. I design the structure, constraints, and philosophy; AI helps accelerate the implementation. It’s a collaboration between human direction and machine precision, and I’m slowly becoming more fluent in both roles.

A key part of this ecosystem is something I developed called the Synavera Script Etiquette (SSE).
It’s a set of guidelines I use to keep code—whether written by me, AI, or future contributors—consistent in clarity, explicitness, and intent. Think of it as the heartbeat that keeps Synavera’s projects aligned, even as they evolve.

<summary><strong>Projects currently taking shape include</strong></summary>
  
- **Syn-Syu** — A cognitive successor to pacman's -Syu function. Downloads via pacman and AUR helper, choosing the most recent version per-package, with Flatpak and fwupd as QoL inclusions with plans to expand into a Linux system-state auditor and update-introspection tool.
- **DCIPHERED** — A multi-tier system-diagnostics daemon built around transparency, safety, and auditable telemetry.  
- **SIGIL** - A cryptographic authentication layer with tamper-evident logic and explicit security rituals.
- **Syn-OTP** — a transparent, vendor-agnostic authenticator with optional hardware-backed secret storage.

These tools are still evolving. They’re experiments grounded in a consistent ethos, not finished products pretending to be polished. If they become useful beyond my own desk, I’ll be glad. If others join in later, even better. For now, this space is my workshop—a place to explore, document, improve, and build responsibly.

Synavera isn’t a conventional company.
It’s the name I’ve given to a philosophy: software should empower the user, not obscure them.
